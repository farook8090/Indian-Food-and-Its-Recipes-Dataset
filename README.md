# 🍲 Recipe Image Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset designed for a Deep Learning–based “Image to Recipe” model, which predicts ingredients and recipes from food images.

# 📊 About the Dataset

Context: The dataset was created to support research in computer vision and deep learning for food recognition.

Source: Images and recipes were scraped from Archana’s Kitchen
.

Data Collection: Images were downloaded using a custom Python script.

Scraping code: Web-Scrapping-For-Cuisines

# 🔍 EDA Objectives

Explore dataset structure and metadata.

Analyze distribution of cuisines, ingredients, and recipes.

Identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Visualize category distributions (cuisine types, recipe counts, etc.).

Generate insights for building a robust deep learning model.

# 🧑‍💻 Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

# 🚀 Outcomes

Provided insights into the dataset composition and balance.

Highlighted data quality issues (missing/duplicate entries).

Created visualizations to understand recipe and cuisine diversity.

Prepared a strong foundation for model building (Image-to-Recipe).
